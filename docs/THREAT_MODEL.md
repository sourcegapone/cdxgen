# Threat Model

This document describes the threat model for cdxgen — a polyglot CycloneDX BOM generator that produces SBOM, CBOM, OBOM, SaaSBOM, CDXA, and VDR documents. It identifies threat actors, attack surfaces, trust boundaries, and mitigations across cdxgen's components: CLI, library, HTTP server, REPL, CI/CD infrastructure, container images, dependencies, and the optional native helper binaries supplied through `cdxgen-plugins-bin`.

## System Overview

cdxgen generates CycloneDX Bill-of-Materials (BOM) documents — including SBOM, CBOM, OBOM, SaaSBOM, CDXA, and VDR — by parsing project manifests/lockfiles and optionally invoking external build tools. It also opportunistically uses optional helper binaries from `cdxgen-plugins-bin` such as Trivy (container/rootfs OS inventory), osquery (live-OS OBOM), trustinspector (filesystem/signing/trust inventory), SourceKitten, and dosai. It operates in six modes:

1. **CLI** (`bin/cdxgen.js`) — Command-line invocation on local projects
2. **Library** (`lib/cli/index.js`) — Programmatic use via `createBom(path, options)`
3. **HTTP Server** (`lib/server/server.js`) — REST API accepting scan requests, optionally with Git clone
4. **REPL** (`bin/repl.js`) — Interactive shell for ad-hoc BOM operations
5. **Evinse** (`bin/evinse.js`) — Evidence generation for SBOM verification (analyzes call stacks, data flows, and usages)
6. **Verify** (`bin/verify.js`) — BOM signature verification using JWS

## Threats and Mitigations by Component

### 1. CLI and Library (`bin/cdxgen.js`, `lib/cli/index.js`)

#### T1.1 — Command injection via project files

**Threat:** Attacker-controlled values from manifests or lockfiles (package names, versions, URLs) are passed to `safeSpawnSync` in a way that escapes command boundaries.

**Mitigations:**

- `safeSpawnSync` uses array-based arguments (not shell strings) via `spawnSync`, preventing shell metacharacter injection
- Command allowlisting via `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` — only explicitly permitted commands can execute
- In secure mode, automatic package installations are disabled, reducing the set of commands invoked
- `commandsExecuted` tracks all invoked commands for post-run audit

**Residual risk:** Medium — cdxgen invokes many different commands with project-derived arguments. Continuous review is needed as new language support is added.

#### T1.2 — Arbitrary code execution via build tools

**Threat:** cdxgen invokes `npm install`, `mvn`, `pip install`, `gradle`, etc. These tools execute code from project files (postinstall scripts, `setup.py`, Gradle build scripts).

**Mitigations:**

- Secure mode (`CDXGEN_SECURE_MODE=true`) disables automatic package installation
- `safeSpawnSync` warns when `pip`/`uv install` is invoked without `--only-binary=:all:` (prevents `setup.py` execution during wheel builds)
- `safeSpawnSync` warns when Python is invoked without `-S` flag
- Users are advised to run in sandboxed environments for untrusted projects

**Residual risk:** High — this is a fundamental tension. Accurate dependency resolution often requires invoking build tools that may execute untrusted code. Secure mode trades accuracy for safety.

#### T1.3 — Environment variable poisoning

**Threat:** Attacker sets `NODE_OPTIONS` with `--require` or `--eval` to inject code, or manipulates `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, proxy variables, or TLS settings.

**Mitigations:**

- `auditEnvironment()` runs at startup and detects:
  - Code execution patterns in `NODE_OPTIONS` (`--require`, `--eval`, `--import`, `--loader`, `--inspect`)
  - JVM agent injection in `MVN_ARGS`, `GRADLE_ARGS`, `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
  - Module resolution poisoning via `NODE_PATH`
  - Disabled TLS verification (`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`)
  - Credential-like variables
  - Debug mode exposure
  - Running as root outside containers
  - Proxy interception variables
- Findings are reported with severity ratings and remediation guidance

**Residual risk:** Medium — `auditEnvironment` is pattern-based and may not catch novel obfuscation. An attacker who can set environment variables often already has significant access.

#### T1.4 — Path traversal via file inputs

**Threat:** Attacker crafts file paths with `../`, Unicode tricks, or Windows device names to read or write outside the intended project directory.

**Mitigations:**

- `hasDangerousUnicode()` detects bidirectional control characters, zero-width characters, and other obfuscation
- `isValidDriveRoot()` prevents Unicode lookalike drive letters on Windows (CVE-2025-27210 mitigation)
- Node.js `--permission` model (in secure mode) restricts filesystem access to explicitly allowed paths
- `safeExistsSync` and `safeMkdirSync` check permissions before operations

**Residual risk:** Low in secure mode, Medium in default mode.

#### T1.5 — Remote source scanning via git URL and purl inputs

**Threat:** A user (or wrapper tool) supplies a malicious git URL or purl that resolves to an unsafe repository.

**Mitigations:**

- CLI and server both use shared source validation (`validateAndRejectGitSource()`) and hardened clone behavior
- Protocol allowlisting via `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` / `CDXGEN_GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`
- Host allowlisting via `CDXGEN_GIT_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (or `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in server mode)
- Temporary clone directories are removed after scan completion
- purl resolution emits an explicit warning that registry metadata may be untrusted

**Residual risk:** Medium — trust is delegated to external registry metadata and remote repository hosting unless strict allowlists are configured.

#### T1.6 — Malicious archive metadata in packaged release artifacts

**Threat:** An attacker ships a crafted ASAR archive with malformed header data, path-like entry names, integrity mismatches, or unpacked/native payloads intended to confuse inventory, trigger unsafe extraction behavior, or hide high-risk runtime capabilities.

**Mitigations:**

- Native ASAR parsing validates header structure before walking entries
- Entry names containing path separators or traversal markers are rejected during header validation
- Archive inventory records both declared integrity metadata and computed SHA-256 hashes for file components
- `.asar.unpacked` extraction only writes within a temp directory created through safe wrappers
- `--dry-run` still blocks temp extraction even for ASAR scans, while allowing in-memory header and file-content analysis
- JavaScript capability analysis highlights eval/code generation, dynamic fetch/import, network, filesystem, hardware, and child-process indicators in packaged source files

**Residual risk:** Medium — cdxgen can inventory and verify what is present, but a trusted-looking packaged archive may still contain malicious application logic that requires human review or runtime sandboxing to fully assess.

#### T1.7 — Compromised or substituted helper binary

**Threat:** cdxgen executes optional native helpers from `cdxgen-plugins-bin` (for example Trivy, osquery, and trustinspector). A compromised, replaced, or unexpected binary could tamper with scan output or execute malicious logic. Separately, a forged `plugins-manifest.json` could attempt to spoof helper metadata recorded in `metadata.tools`.

**Mitigations:**

- Helper execution still flows through `safeSpawnSync`, command allowlisting, and the general secure-mode guardrails
- Optional helper package versions are pinned in `package.json`, and the companion repository generates post-build metadata/SBOMs for shipped binaries
- `plugins-manifest.json` is treated as data only: cdxgen does not execute commands, paths, or scripts from the manifest
- Manifest ingestion is constrained to the real `plugins-manifest.json` file under `CDXGEN_PLUGINS_DIR`, requires a regular file, enforces a size bound, and sanitizes accepted fields before merging them into `metadata.tools`
- Docker/rootfs tests assert non-cdxgen tool identity evidence and container/rootfs result parity, making silent helper-behavior drift easier to detect in CI
- macOS osquery execution uses one-shot shell mode with the persistent database disabled, reducing the need for helper-managed state under privileged host paths such as `/var/osquery`

**Residual risk:** Medium — helper binaries remain executable third-party/native code and expand the trusted computing base for deep OS/container inventory. A malicious actor who can replace the plugin directory can still spoof helper metadata or swap binaries, but that is a local integrity problem rather than a new command-injection path through manifest parsing.

#### T1.8 — Malicious rootfs repository or trusted-key metadata

**Threat:** A crafted image or root filesystem plants misleading repository source files or trusted key material so that the BOM reflects false trust relationships or reviewer-confusing crypto inventory.

**Mitigations:**

- Repository source entries are modeled as `type: data` with explicit `cdx:os:repo:*` provenance properties including source path and URL
- Trusted key files are modeled as `type: cryptographic-asset` with hashes, source paths, trust-domain properties, and schema-valid `cryptoProperties`
- When repo config explicitly references a key (`signed-by`, `gpgkey`), cdxgen emits a dependency edge from the repository component to the corresponding key asset instead of flattening the relationship away
- Docker/rootfs regression tests compare archive and reconstructed-rootfs signatures so repo/key inventory drift is caught during CI

**Residual risk:** Medium — cdxgen inventories what exists on disk and can preserve trust relationships, but it cannot prove that the configured repositories or keys are themselves benign or organization-approved.

### 2. HTTP Server (`lib/server/server.js`)

#### T2.1 — Path traversal via scan requests

**Threat:** A client sends a scan request with a path like `/app/../../../etc/passwd` to scan or access files outside allowed directories.

**Mitigations:**

- `isAllowedPath()` resolves paths and checks they are within `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_PATHS`
- Uses `path.relative()` to detect `..` traversal
- `hasDangerousUnicode()` blocks Unicode obfuscation in paths
- `isAllowedWinPath()` blocks Windows device names, UNC paths, and invalid drive roots
- Body parser has 1MB request size limit

**Residual risk:** Low when `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_PATHS` is configured. Medium when unconfigured (any path is scannable).

#### T2.2 — Git clone exploits

**Threat:** A client sends a Git URL that exploits Git features to execute code during clone (e.g., `ext::` protocol, `fd::` protocol, malicious submodules).

**Mitigations:**

- `validateAndRejectGitSource()` rejects dangerous protocols (`ext::`, `fd::`)
- Validates URL format and hostname against `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- Git clone uses hardened configuration:
  - `core.fsmonitor=false` — disables filesystem monitor hooks
  - `safe.bareRepository=explicit` — prevents bare repo attacks
  - `-c alias.clone=` — prevents alias abuse
  - `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` — disables hook execution entirely
  - `--template=` — prevents OS hook templates from being copied into the new repo
  - `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` in secure mode — prevents reading system/user configs including Git 2.54 `hook.<name>.command` entries
  - `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` — prevents interactive prompts
  - `--depth 1` — limits history to reduce attack surface
- `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` defaults to `https:ssh` in secure mode

**Residual risk:** Low — multiple layers of Git hardening are applied.

#### T2.3 — Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Threat:** A client triggers cdxgen to make HTTP requests to internal hosts via package registry lookups or Git clone URLs.

**Mitigations:**

- `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` restricts `cdxgenAgent` outbound connections
- `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS` restricts Git clone target hosts
- Server-side Dependency-Track submission host checks require exact matches or real subdomain matches for wildcard entries (for example, `*.example.com` matches `api.example.com` but not `evil-example.com`)
- Dependency-Track submission redirects are disabled so an allowlisted host cannot bounce uploads to a different destination
- Secure mode enforces HTTPS-only
- Redirect following is disabled in secure mode

**Residual risk:** Medium — build tools invoked by cdxgen make their own HTTP requests that are not controlled by `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

#### T2.6 — Registry metadata poisoning for purl requests

**Threat:** A purl request resolves through registry metadata (`repository`, `homepage`, or similar fields) to attacker-controlled repositories.

**Mitigations:**

- purl-to-repository resolution is restricted to known ecosystems and then validated with git protocol + host allowlists
- Host allowlists can block unexpected repository hosts even when metadata is poisoned
- cdxgen logs warnings when using registry-derived repository URLs

**Residual risk:** Medium — poisoned metadata can still redirect scans if allowlists are broad or unset.

#### T2.4 — Denial of service

**Threat:** A client sends many concurrent requests, very large bodies, or requests for enormous projects to exhaust server resources.

**Mitigations:**

- Body parser limit: 1MB
- Server timeout: 10 minutes (configurable via `CDXGEN_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Spawn timeout: 20 minutes (configurable via `CDXGEN_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Max buffer: 100MB (configurable via `CDXGEN_MAX_BUFFER`)

**Residual risk:** Medium — no built-in rate limiting or concurrent request limits. The server is designed for trusted internal use. Deploy behind a reverse proxy for production exposure.

#### T2.5 — No authentication or authorization

**Threat:** Any client that can reach the server can trigger scans, potentially accessing the host filesystem.

**Mitigations:**

- `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_PATHS` restricts scannable directories
- Users are expected to deploy behind a reverse proxy with authentication
- The server is intended for internal/CI use, not public exposure

**Residual risk:** High if exposed without access controls. Low in intended deployment behind a reverse proxy.

### 3. Dependencies

#### T3.1 — Compromised npm dependency

**Threat:** A direct or transitive dependency publishes a malicious update that executes code when imported.

**Mitigations:**

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` provides reproducible installs with integrity hashes
- `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` restricts which packages can run install scripts
- Renovate provides automated dependency updates with CI testing
- CodeQL scanning runs on the codebase
- npm provenance attestation on published packages
- Optional heavy dependencies (atom, server middleware) are in `optionalDependencies` to reduce the attack surface of minimal installs

**Residual risk:** Medium — supply-chain attacks on npm packages are an industry-wide threat. cdxgen has a moderate dependency tree.

#### T3.2 — Dependency confusion

**Threat:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a private dependency to a public registry.

**Mitigations:**

- cdxgen uses only public npm packages; no private registry dependencies
- All dependencies are explicitly versioned in `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins exact versions with integrity hashes

**Residual risk:** Low.

### 4. CI/CD Infrastructure

#### T4.1 — GitHub Actions supply-chain attack

**Threat:** A compromised GitHub Action or workflow modification injects malicious code into cdxgen releases.

**Mitigations:**

- All GitHub Actions are pinned to full SHA digests (not mutable tags)
- `permissions: {}` default (no permissions) at workflow level; explicit per-job grants
- `persist-credentials: false` on all checkout steps
- npm provenance (`NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true`) provides verifiable build attestation
- Concurrency controls prevent parallel release workflows

**Residual risk:** Low — strong workflow hardening practices are in place.

#### T4.2 — Self-hosted runner compromise

**Threat:** A self-hosted CI runner is compromised, allowing an attacker to tamper with builds or access secrets.

**Mitigations:**

- Self-hosted runners are used only for specific heavy jobs (e.g., depscan analysis)
- Workflow permissions are scoped to specific jobs
- `persist-credentials: false` limits credential exposure
- Jobs on self-hosted runners do not have release/publish permissions

**Residual risk:** Medium — self-hosted runners inherently have a larger trust boundary than GitHub-hosted runners.

#### T4.3 — Release integrity

**Threat:** An attacker modifies the npm package or container image between build and publish.

**Mitigations:**

- npm provenance attestation links published packages to specific GitHub Actions runs
- Container base images are pinned to SHA digests
- Multi-platform container builds use consistent base images
- CodeQL analysis runs on PRs and pushes

**Residual risk:** Low.

### 5. Container Images

#### T5.1 — Container escape

**Threat:** A vulnerability in the container runtime or cdxgen's container configuration allows escaping to the host.

**Mitigations:**

- `cdxgen-secure` image runs as non-root user (`cyclonedx`)
- Node.js `--permission` model restricts filesystem and child process access within the container
- Limited `--allow-fs-write` to temp and output directories only
- `COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=0` prevents accidental root operations

**Residual risk:** Low for cdxgen-specific vectors. Container runtime vulnerabilities are the responsibility of the runtime vendor.

#### T5.2 — Vulnerable base image

**Threat:** The base container image contains known vulnerabilities.

**Mitigations:**

- Base images are pinned to SHA digests for reproducibility
- Images are regularly rebuilt with updated dependencies
- CI builds test images before publishing

**Residual risk:** Low — regular rebuilds reduce the window of vulnerability.

### 6. SBOM Output

#### T6.1 — Sensitive data in SBOM

**Threat:** Generated SBOMs contain sensitive information (file paths, emails, secrets, internal hostnames) that is inadvertently shared.

**Mitigations:**

- `thoughtLog` performs limited log normalization (for example, replacing the literal `'.'` with `'<project dir>'`), but logs may still include direct or absolute paths
- Warning when `--include-formulation` is used with `--server-url` (formulation may contain emails and secrets)
- In secure mode, using `--include-formulation` with `--server-url` calls `process.exit(1)` after the warning, preventing automatic upload of formulation data
- `auditEnvironment` detects and warns about credential-like environment variables
- Secret-bearing BOM metadata values are sanitized before emission in AI/MCP inventory and Chrome extension metadata flows:
  - URLs and URIs drop userinfo, query strings, and fragments
  - inline credential patterns are redacted
  - raw command strings are reduced to safer summaries such as the executable name
  - dangerous structured keys such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` are removed before JSON serialization

**Residual risk:** Medium — SBOMs inherently contain metadata about the project. Users should review SBOMs before sharing, especially when formulation data is included.

#### T6.2 — SBOM tampering in transit

**Threat:** An SBOM is modified during upload to a BOM server (Dependency-Track, etc.).

**Mitigations:**

- Secure mode enforces HTTPS-only for all connections including SBOM upload
- cdxgen supports SBOM signing via `SBOM_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY`

**Residual risk:** Low when secure mode and SBOM signing are enabled.

## Recommendations for Deployers

1. **Use secure mode** — Set `CDXGEN_SECURE_MODE=true` and configure `NODE_OPTIONS` with the Node.js permission model, or use the `ghcr.io/cyclonedx/cdxgen-secure` container image.
2. **Configure allowlists** — Set `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` based on your project types. Run once without allowlists and use the suggested values from cdxgen's output.
3. **Restrict server paths and remote hosts** — When running in server mode, always set `CDXGEN_ALLOWED_PATHS` (or `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_PATHS`) and `CDXGEN_GIT_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (or `CDXGEN_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`).
4. **Deploy server behind a proxy** — The cdxgen server has no built-in authentication. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Envoy, etc.) with authentication and rate limiting.
5. **Sandbox untrusted projects** — Scan untrusted code in containers or ephemeral CI environments, not on developer machines.
6. **Review environment** — Check `auditEnvironment` output for warnings. Remediate HIGH severity findings before production use.
7. **Enable trace logging in CI** — Set `CDXGEN_TRACE_MODE=true` in CI pipelines for auditability of commands and network access.
8. **Review generated metadata before sharing** — Even with built-in redaction, inspect BOM properties when scanning AI/MCP configs, agent instructions, or browser extension manifests.
9. **Keep cdxgen updated** — Apply updates promptly, especially those that reference security fixes.
