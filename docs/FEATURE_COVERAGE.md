# Feature Coverage Map

This page answers a simple question: where is each major cdxgen capability already documented?

It is especially useful when you are looking for dry-run behavior, BOM audit, predictive audit, validation, or other command-specific workflows without searching the whole docs tree.

## Feature-specific pointers

### Dry-run mode

Use these docs together:

| Doc                             | What it adds                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLI.md`                        | the user-facing behavior of `--dry-run` for normal cdxgen usage |
| `BOM_AUDIT.md`                  | how BOM audit behaves differently in dry-run mode               |
| `HBOM.md`                       | HBOM-specific dry-run semantics and partial-output behavior     |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS_AND_COMMANDS.md` | how allowlist review interacts with dry-run workflows           |

### BOM audit vs predictive audit

These are related but not identical.

```text
generated BOM
   |
   +--> direct BOM audit      -> rules evaluated against the current BOM
   |
   +--> predictive audit      -> upstream targets selected for deeper inspection
```

| Capability                                  | Best doc       |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| direct rule evaluation after generation     | `BOM_AUDIT.md` |
| dedicated upstream dependency risk analysis | `CDX_AUDIT.md` |
| dry-run interaction with audit behavior     | `BOM_AUDIT.md` |

### Validation

| Doc                  | What it covers                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CDX_VALIDATE.md`    | standalone `cdx-validate` command, benchmarks, reporters, and exit codes |
| `CLI.md`             | how validation fits into the main CLI experience                         |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | how to debug validation failures in generated BOMs                       |

## Purpose of this document

The documentation already covers the features you called out. The problem was discoverability, not total absence. This file is meant to make that coverage visible and navigable.
